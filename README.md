# daoc_log_parse
Python modified script to parse chat log data

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/

System Properties -> Environment Variables -> Under section System Variables
Click Variable "Path" -> Edit
Make sure folder for where you installed python is there. If not I would do "New" button and type the folder to Python example: C:\Python27
Also add the Script folder for any future convenience example: C:\Python27\Scripts
